Final result: The correct answer specifically states the result as 5 hours per day, while the step gives a different daily practice time and overall duration.\n\nThe calculations and approach in the correct answer are more detailed and aligned with the given constraints, leading to a different and more accurate result."

It determines Randy has 8 years until he's 20\n2. It calculates 1,250 hours of practice needed per year (10,000 hours / 8 years)\n3. It accounts for 50 weeks of practice per year (52 weeks - 2 weeks vacation)\n4. It calculates 250 practice days per year (50 weeks * 5 days per week)\n5. Finally, it arrives at 5 hours of practice per day (1,250 hours / 250 days)\n\nThe step's conclusion of 15.7 hours per day is significantly different from the correct answer of 5 hours per day."
